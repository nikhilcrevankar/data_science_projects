Clustering algorithms are used to group together items that are similar to one another. There are many industries where it would be beneficial and insightful to use an unsupervised learning algorithm - retailers want to group similar customers for targeted ad campaigns, biologists want to find plants that share similar characteristics, and more. We are going to explore if it would be appropriate to use some clustering algorithms to group medical patients. 

We are going to look at anonymized patients who have been diagnosed with heart disease. Patients with similar characteristics might respond to the same treatments, and doctors would benefit from learning about the outcomes of patients similar to those they are treating. 

This project applies clustering using the k-means and hierarchical clustering algorithms.
